# How to create and publish a Laravel package on packagist
A Laravel package is a set of reusable classes created to add extra functionality to a Laravel website. In clearer terms, a package is to Laravel, what plugins are to WordPress. The primary goal of Laravel packages is to reduce development time by making reusable features into a set of standalone classes that can be used within any Laravel project.

## Getting Started
- Create a fresh laravel package

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel packagetestapp

Or

You can install the package via composer:

composer require chargefield/laravel-widget
```
- change directory to the new folder

```
cd packagetestapp
```

- When it's done you need to configure your env file and set your app key and other necessary details. In your terminal type:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

- generate the app key

```
php artisan key:generate
```
- create a folder called `packages`, then create a new folder called samuelayo. 
> Note that you can subtitute samuelayo with your own vendor name. Be sure to change the refrence in every other aspect of the app

- clone this repository to the newly created folder

 
- Tell Laravel how to load our package and use it's functions, so inside the root of your Laravel app in the composer.json add this code:

```

"autoload": {
        "classmap": [
            "database/seeds",
            "database/factories"
        ],
        "psr-4": {
            "mdhossain\\laravel-logs\\": "packages/mdhossain/laravel-logs/src",
            "App\\": "app/"
        }
    },
    "autoload-dev": {
        "psr-4": {
            "mdhossain\\laravel-logs\\": "packages/mdhossain/laravel-logs/src",
            "Tests\\": "tests/"
        }
    },
```
- Dump the composer autoloader

```
composer dump-autoload
```

- Next, we need to add our new Service Provider in our `config/app.php` inside the `providers` array:

```
'providers' => [
         ...,
            App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider::class,
            // Our new package class
         ],
```
- Migrate the database tables

```
php artisan migrate
```

And finally, start the application by running:

```
php artisan serve
```

If you want to include the project as a package to your app, run:

```
composer require samuelayo/contactform
```
